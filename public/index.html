                                <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting
                                    by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing
                                    to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book
                                    her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                                    conversations in it, &#8220;and what is the use
                                    of a book,&#8221; thought Alice &#8220;without
                                    pictures or conversation?&#8221;</p>

                                <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as
                                    she could, for the hot day made her feel very
                                    sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of <a
                                            href="#">making a daisy-chain</a> would
                                    be worth the trouble of getting up and picking
                                    the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with
                                    pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

                                <p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in
                                    that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em>
                                    much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
                                    itself, &#8220;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!&#8221;
                                    (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
                                    to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
                                    but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but
                                    when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of
                                        its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it,
                                    and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
                                    for <a href="#">it flashed across her</a> mind
                                    that she had never before seen a rabbit with
                                    either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out
                                    of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
                                    the field after it, and fortunately was just in
                                    time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under
                                    the hedge.</p>

                                <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never
                                    once considering how in the world she was to get
                                    out again.</p>

                                <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for
                                    some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so
                                    suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
                                    about stopping herself before she found herself
                                    falling down a very deep well.</p>

                                <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
                                    slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went
                                    down to look about her and to wonder what was
                                    going to happen next. First, she tried to look
                                    down and make out what she was coming to, but it
                                    was too dark to see anything; then she looked at
                                    the sides of the well, and noticed that they were
                                    filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and
                                    there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
                                    She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
                                    she passed; it was labelled &#8220;<a href="#">ORANGE
                                        MARMALADE</a>&#8220;, but to her great
                                    disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
                                    drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so
                                    managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
                                    she fell past it.</p>

                                <p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; thought Alice to herself,
                                    &#8220;after such a fall as this, I shall think
                                    nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&#8217;ll
                                    all think me at home! Why, I wouldn&#8217;t say
                                    anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
                                    the house!&#8221; (Which was very likely
                                    true.)</p>

                                <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em>
                                    come to an end! &#8220;I wonder how many miles I&#8217;ve
                                    fallen by this time?&#8221; she said aloud.
                                    &#8220;I must be getting somewhere near the
                                    centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be
                                    four thousand miles down, I think � &#8221; (for,
                                    you see, Alice had learnt several things of this
                                    sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
                                    this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for
                                    showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
                                    listen to her, still it was good practice to say
                                    it over) &#8221; � yes, that&#8217;s about the
                                    right distance � but then I wonder what Latitude
                                    or Longitude I&#8217;ve got to?&#8221; (Alice had
                                    no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either,
                                    but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
                                </p>

                                <p>Presently she began again. &#8220;I wonder if I
                                    shall fall right <em>through</em> the earth! How
                                    funny it&#8221;ll seem to come out among the
                                    people that walk with their heads downward! The
                                    Antipathies, I think � &#8221; (she was rather
                                    glad there <em>was</em> no one listening, this
                                    time, as it didn&#8217;t sound at all the right
                                    word) &#8221; � but I shall have to ask them what
                                    the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma&#8217;am,
                                    is this New Zealand or Australia?&#8221; (and she
                                    tried to curtsey as she spoke � fancy <em>curtseying</em>
                                    as you&#8221;re falling through the air! Do you
                                    think you could manage it?) &#8220;And what an <a
                                            href="#">ignorant little girl</a> she&#8221;ll
                                    think me for asking! No, it&#8217;ll never do to
                                    ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&#8221;
                                </p>

                                <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so
                                    Alice soon began talking again. &#8220;Dinah&#8221;ll
                                    miss me very much to-night, I should think!&#8221;
                                    (Dinah was the cat.) &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll
                                    remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my
                                    dear! I wish you were down here with me! There
                                    are no mice in the air, I&#8217;m afraid, but you
                                    might catch a bat, and that&#8217;s very like a
                                    mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&#8221;
                                    And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and
                                    went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
                                    way, &#8220;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&#8221;
                                    and sometimes, &#8220;Do bats eat cats?&#8221;
                                    for, you see, as she couldn&#8217;t answer either
                                    question, it didn&#8217;t much matter which way
                                    she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and
                                    had just begun to dream that she was walking hand
                                    in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
                                    earnestly, &#8220;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
                                    did you ever eat a bat?&#8221; when suddenly,
                                    thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks
                                    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

                                <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to
                                    her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was
                                    all dark overhead; before her was another long
                                    passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
                                    hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be
                                    lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just
                                    in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,
                                    &#8220;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#8217;s
                                    getting!&#8221; She was close behind it when she
                                    turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer
                                    to be seen: she found herself in a long, low
                                    hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
                                    from the roof.</p>

                                <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were
                                    all locked; and when Alice had been all the way
                                    down one side and up the other, trying every
                                    door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering
                                    how she was ever to get out again.</p>

                                <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
                                    table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
                                    on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&#8217;s
                                    first thought was that it might belong to one of
                                    the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
                                    locks were too large, or the key was too small,
                                    but at any rate it would not open any of them.
                                    However, on the second time round, she came upon
                                    a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
                                    behind it was a little door about fifteen inches
                                    high: she tried the little golden key in the
                                    lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>
